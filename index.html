            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s.</p>
            <p>The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.</p>

                    <p>The first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code.</p>
                    <p>In March 2009 <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8">Version 8.0</a> was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8 offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1.</p>

                    <p>The project which became <a href = "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" >Firefox</a> started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.</p>
                    <p>Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element, and a new global browser console, among other things.</p>

                    <p>Google's Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."</p>
                    <p>In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an official <a href = "https://chromeenterprise.google/download/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2024-H2-chromebrowser-paidmed-paiddisplay-other-chromebrowserent&utm_term=downloadnow-chrome-browser-enterprise-download&utm_content=GCGX&brand=GCGX&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADJomwfQFTSgSylBRUrNvd_O4CYX7&gclid=CjwKCAjw9eO3BhBNEiwAoc0-jTZIp0k6mXfJvg1N1nvpOrweeioG3oXQmXTQF4ehmwmpSLySMroSoRoC5XwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Chrome MSI package</a>.</p>
