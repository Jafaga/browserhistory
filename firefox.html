        <h2 class="chapter">Chapter 2: Fire Fox</h2>
        <p>The project which became <a href = "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" > Firefox</a> started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). 
            After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.<p>Firefox 23 was released on 
            August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation 
            of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to "switch to a 
            different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.</p>
